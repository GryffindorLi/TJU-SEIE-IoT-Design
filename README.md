# TJU-SEIE-IoT-Design
This is the final project of Internet of Things Design in School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University. This course is taught by Associate Professor Lyu Wei in 2020 Fall.

## Introduction

We build a motion dense estimation system based on Backgroud Subtractor. Our system can generate motion heap map as well as estimate the motion density(the number of moving object in a specific area). Based on the density we estimated, this system can be applied to various fields.
